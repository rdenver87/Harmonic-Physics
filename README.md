# Harmonic-Physics
Development in progress... 

Welcome to new science! 
Harmonic physics through The Periodic Table of Elements! 

The generator spreadsheet is a work in progress, the current first version is a hybrid of the original number set {2,6,7,8,10,12,14,16,20}
and combinational sine possibilities applicable to the analysis of all elements. 

The generator is locked by default and completely unlockable to be edited and developed further by anyone! 

To use the generator: Enter proton, neutron and electron data into the box to the left underneath the visual geometry (unlocked by default).

A full list of The Periodic Table of Elements is included, as well as a sheet with combinational analysis data for building gated circuits.
Logisim is free software and useful with binary truth table data and combinational expressions. http://www.cburch.com/logisim/
